&emsp;&emsp;U.S. customers historically tipped people they assumed were earning most of their income via tips, such as restaurant servers earning less than the minimum wage. In the early 2010s, a wide range of businesses started processing purchases with iPads and other digital payment systems. These systems often prompted customers to tip for services that were not previously tipped.
&emsp;&emsp;Today’s tip requests are often not connected to the salary and service norms that used to determine when and how people tip. Customers in the past nearly always paid tips after receiving a service, such as at the conclusion of a restaurant meal, after getting a haircut or once a pizza was delivered. That timing could reward high-quality service and give workers an incentive to provide it. 
&emsp;&emsp;It’s becoming more common for tips to be requested beforehand. And new tipping technology may even automatically add tips.
&emsp;&emsp;The prevalence of digital payment devices has made it easier to ask customers for a tip. That helps explain why tip requests are creeping into new kinds of services. Customers now routinely see menus of suggested default options—often well above 20% of what they owe. The amounts have risen from 10% or less in the 1950s to 15% around the year 2000 to 20% or higher today. This increase is sometimes called tipflation—the expectation of ever-higher tip amounts.
&emsp;&emsp;Tipping has always been a vital source of income for worker in historically tipped services, like restaurants, where the tipped minimum wage can be as low as US $ 2.13 an hour. Tip creep and tipflation are now further supplementing the income of many low-wage service workers.
&emsp;&emsp;Notably, tipping primarily benefits some of these workers, such as waiters, but not others, such as cooks and dishwashers. To ensure that all employees were paid fair wages, some restaurants banned tipping and increased prices, but the movement towards no-tipping services has largely fizzled out.
&emsp;&emsp;So to increase employee wages without raising prices, more employers are succumbing to the temptations of tip creep and tipflation. However, many customers are frustrated because they feel they are being asked for a tip too often. And, as our research emphasizes, tipping now seems to be more coercive, less generous, and often completely dissociated from service quality.  

21. According to Paragraph l, the practice of tipping in the U.S.
[A] was regarded as a sign of generosity  
[B] was considered essential for waiters  
[C] was a way of rewarding diligence  
[D] was optional in most businesses  
22. Compared with tips in the past, today’s tips
[A] are paid much less frequently  
[B] are less often requested in advance  
[C] have less to do with service quality  
[D] contribute less to workers’ income  
23. Tip requests are creeping into new kinds of services as a result of
[A] the advancement of technology  
[B] the desire for income increase

25. It can be learned from the last paragraph that tipping
[A] is becoming a burden for customers  
[B] helps encourage quality service  
[C] is vital to business development  
[D] reflects the need to reduce prices

&emsp;&emsp;When it was established, the National Health Service (NHS) was visionary: offering high-quality, timely care to meet the dominant needs of the population it served. Nearly 75 years on, with the UK facing very different health challenges, it is clear that the model is out of date.
&emsp;&emsp;From life expectancy to cancer and infant mortality rates, we are lagging behind many of our peers. With more than 6.8 million on waitlists, healthcare is becoming increasingly inaccessible for those who cannot opt to pay for private treatment; and the cost of providing healthcare is increasingly squeezing our investment in other public services. As demand for healthcare continues to grow, pressures on the workforce—which is already near breaking point—will only become more acute.
&emsp;&emsp;Many of the answers to the crisis in health and care are well rehearsed. We need to be much better at reducing and diverting demand on health services, rather than simply managing it. Much more needs to be invested in communities and primary care to reduce our reliance on hospitals. And capacity in social care needs to be greater, to support the growing number of people living with long-term conditions.
&emsp;&emsp;Yet despite two decades of strategies and a number of major health reforms, we have failed to make meaningful progress on any of these aims. That is why the Reform think tank is launching a new programme of work entitled “Reimagining health”, supported by ten former health ministers. Together, we are calling for a much more open and honest conversation about the future of health in the UK, and an “urgent rethink” of the hospital-centric model we retain.
&emsp;&emsp;This must begin with the question of how we maximise the health of the nation, rather than “fix” the NHS. It is estimated, for example, that healthcare accounts for only about 20% of health outcomes. Much more important are the places we live, work and socialise—yet there is no clear cross-government strategy for improving these social determinants of health. Worse, when policies like the national obesity strategy are scrapped, taxpayers are left with the hefty price tag of treating the illnesses, like diabetes, that result.
&emsp;&emsp;Reform wants to ask how power and resources should be distributed in our health system. What health functions should remain at the centre, and what should be given to local leaders, often responsible for services that create health, and with a much better understanding of the needs of their populations?

26. According to the first two paragraphs, the NHS
[A] is troubled by funding deficiencies.
[B] can hardly satisfy people’s needs.
[C] can barely retain its current employees.
[D] is rivalled by private medical services.
27. One answer to the crisis in health and care is to
[A] boost the efficiency of hospitals.
[B] lighten the burden on social care.
[C] increase resources for primary care.
[D] reduce the pressure on communities.
28. “Reimagining health” is aimed to
[A] reinforce hospital management.
[B] readjust healthcare regulations.
[C] restructure the health system.
[D] resume suspended health reforms.
29. To maximise the nation’s health, the author suggests
[A] introducing relevant taxation policies.
[B] paying due attention to social factors.
[C] reevaluating major health outcomes.
[D] enhancing the quality of healthcare.
30. It can be inferred that local leaders should
[A] exercise their power more reasonably.
[B] develop a stronger sense of responsibility.
[C] play a bigger role in the health system.
[D] understand people’s health needs better.

&emsp;&emsp;Heat action plans, or HAPs, have been proliferating in India in the past few
years. In general, an HAP spells out when and how officials should issue heat
warnings and alert hospitals and other institutions. Nagpur’s plan, for instance,
calls for hospitals to set aside “cold wards” in the summer for treating heatstroke
patients, and advises builders to give construction laborers a break from work on
very hot days.
&emsp;&emsp;But implementation of existing HAPs has been uneven, according to a March
report from the center for Policy Research. Many lack adequate funding, it found.
And their triggering thresholds often are not customized to the local climate. In
some areas, high daytime temperatures alone might serve as an adequate trigger
for alerts. But in other places, nighttime temperatures or humidity might be as
important a gauge of risk as daytime highs.
&emsp;&emsp;Mumbai’s April heat stroke deaths highlighted the need for more nuanced
and localized warnings, researchers say. That day’s high temperature of roughly
36°C was 1°C shy of the heat wave alert threshold for coastal cities set by national
meteorological authorities. But the effects of the heat were amplified by humidity—
an often neglected factor in heat alert systems—and the lack of shade at the late-
morning outdoor ceremony.
&emsp;&emsp;To help improve HAPs, urban planner Kotharkar’s team is working on a model
plan that outlines best practices and could be adapted to local conditions. Among
other things, she says, all cities should create a vulnerability map to help focus
responses on the populations most at risk.
&emsp;&emsp;Such mapping doesn’t need to be complex, Kotharkar says. “A useful map can
be created by looking at even a few key parameters.” For example, neighborhoods
with a large elderly population or informal dwellings that cope poorly with heat
could get special warnings or be bolstered with cooling centers. The Nagpur project
has already created a risk and vulnerability map, which enabled Kotharkar to tell
officials which neighborhoods to focus on in the event of a heat wave this summer.
&emsp;&emsp;HAPs shouldn’t just include short-term emergency responses, researchers say,
but also recommend medium- to long-term measures that could make communities
cooler. In Nagpur, for example, Kotharkar’s team has been able to advise city
officials about where to plant trees to provide shade. HAPs could also guide efforts
to retrofit homes or modify building regulations. “Reducing deaths in an emergency
is a good target to have, but it’s the lowest target,” says Climate researcher Chandni
Singh.

31. According to Paragraph 1, Nagpur’s plan proposes measures to
[A] tackle extreme weather.
[B] ensure construction quality.
[C] monitor emergency warnings.
[D] address excessive workloads.
32. One problem with existing HAPs is that they
[A] prove too costly to be implemented.
[B] lack localized alert-issuing criteria.
[C] give delayed responses to heat waves.
[D] keep hospitals under great pressure.
34. Mumbai’s case shows that India’s heat alert systems need to
[A] include other factors besides temperature.
[B] take subtle weather changes into account.
[C] prioritize potentially disastrous heat waves.
[D] draw further support from local authorities.
35. Kotharkar holds that a vulnerability map can help
[A] prevent the harm of high humidity.
[B] target areas needing special attention.
[C] expand the Nagpur project’s coverage.
[D] make relief plans for heat-stricken people.
36. According to the last paragraph, researchers believe that HAPs should
[A] focus more on heatstroke treatment.
[B] invite wider public participation.
[C] apply for more government grants.
[D] serve a broader range of purposes.

&emsp;&emsp;Navigating beyond the organised pavements and parks of our urban spaces,
desire paths are the unofficial footprints of a community, revealing the unspoken
preferences, shared shortcuts and collective choices of humans. Often appearing as
trodden dirt tracks through otherwise neat green spaces, these routes of collective
disobedience cut corners, bisect lawns and cross hills, representing the natural
capability of people (and animals) to go from point A to point B most effectively.
&emsp;&emsp;Urban planners interpret desire paths as more than just convenient shortcuts;
they offer valuable insights into the dynamics between planning and behaviour.
Ohio State University allowed its students to navigate the Oval, a lawn in the
centre of campus, freely, then proceeded to pave the desire paths, creating a web of
effective routes students had established.
&emsp;&emsp;Yet, reluctance persists among other planners to integrate desire paths into
formal plans, citing concerns about safety, environmental impact, or primarily,
aesthetics. A Reddit webpage devoted to the phenomenon, boasting nearly 50,000
members, showcases images of local desire paths adorned with signs instructing
pedestrians to adhere to designated walkways, underscoring the rebellious nature
inherent in these human-made tracks. This clash highlights an ongoing struggle
between the organic, user-driven evolution of public spaces and the desire for a
visually curated and controlled urban environment.
&emsp;&emsp;The Wickguasgeck Trail is an example of a historical desire path, created
by Native Americans to traverse the forests of Manhattan and move between
settlements quickly. This trail, when Dutch colonists arrived, was widened and
made into one of the main trade roads across the island, known at the time as de
Heere Straat, or Gentlemen’s Street. Following the British assumption of control in
New York, the street was renamed Broadway. Notably, Broadway stands out as one
of the few areas in NYC that defies the grid-based system applied to the rest of the
city, cutting a diagonal across parts of the city.
&emsp;&emsp;In online spaces, desire paths have sparked a fascination that can approach
obsession, with the Reddit page serving as a hub. Contributors offer a wide array of
stories, from little-known new shortcuts to long-established alternate routes.
&emsp;&emsp;Animal desire paths, such as ducks forging trails through frozen ponds or dogs
carving direct routes in gardens, highlight the adaptability of these trails in both
human and animal experiences. As desire paths criss-cross through both physical
and virtual landscapes, they stand as a proof of the collective insistence on forging
unconventional routes and embracing the spirit of communal choice.

36. According to Paragraph l, desire paths are a result of
[A] the curiosity to explore surrounding hills.
[B] the necessity to preserve green spaces.
[C] the tendency to pursue convenience.
[D] the wish to find comfort in solitude.
37. It can be inferred that Ohio State University
[A] intends to improve its desire paths.
[B] leads in the research on desire paths.
[C] guides the creation of its desire paths.
[D] takes a positive view of desire paths.
38. The images on the Reddit webpage reflect
[A] conflicting opinions on the use of desire paths.
[B] the call to upgrade the designing of public spaces.
[C] the demand for proper planning of desire paths.
[D] growing concerns over the loss of public spaces.
39. The example of the Wickguasgeck Trail illustrates
[A] the growth of New York City.
[B] the Dutch origin of desire paths.
[C] the importance of urban planning.
[D] the recognition of desire paths.
40. It can be learned from the last paragraph that desire paths
[A] reveal humans’ deep respect for nature.
[B] are crucial to humans’ mental wellbeing.
[C] are a human imitation of animal behaviour.
[D] show a shared trait in humans and animals.
